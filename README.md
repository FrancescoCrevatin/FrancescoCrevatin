- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrancescoCrevatin and I'm a Freelancer programmer and designer. My services include projects in Arduino, C ++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Wix and Shopify (Web Sites), Flutter and Android App (Applications). In addition I also offer services as a Graphic Designer with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that comes across the programming world, because every technological thing we see and use was designed by a person who wanted to bring innovation and progression, just like me
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with anyone who can help me develop my skills and knowledge, even in projects and ideas in which I might be a little weak, so that I can test myself and give my best to complete the project in the best possible way. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email -> official.crevatinfrancesco@gmail.com
